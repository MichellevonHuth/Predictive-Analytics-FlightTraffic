## Abstract

This project focuses on forecasting air traffic in Denmark under a hypothetical non-pandemic scenario. It compares the predictive performance of two forecasting models: ARIMA and ETS. The study utilizes empirical data from 2001 to 2022 on departing passengers from public airports in Denmark. Exploratory data analysis techniques were applied to understand the time series patterns. The data were transformed and checked for stationarity, considering the effects of seasonal and first differences. Structural break tests were conducted to identify changes in data patterns.

## Research Question

"What is the most appropriate forecasting technique, specifically between ARIMA and ETS models, for accurately predicting air traffic in Denmark under a hypothetical non-pandemic scenario?"

## Data

The dataset for this study was gathered from the FLYV92 report available on the StatBank Denmark Transportation portal, provided by Statistics Denmark. It covers a 22-year span from January 2001 to March 2023 with a monthly frequency. The data was truncated to January 2020 for easier use, providing 264 observations.

## How to Use

To reproduce the results or extend the project:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Predictive-Analytics-FlightTraffic.git
    ```

2. Explore the R scripts in the `code` directory to understand the implementation of ARIMA and ETS models.

3. Use the provided dataset or replace it with your own dataset, ensuring it follows the same structure.

4. Run the R scripts to conduct the forecasting analysis.
